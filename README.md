# CSV-divider-Splitting-CSV-files-in-pieces

Sometimes files are too large to be opened in Excel. This simple code is created to split/divide large CSV files into smaller ones, so that they can be worked with in Excel (or other app).

How to use:

Provide path to the existing file, specify the starting name of the split files. 
Split files will have the starting name and number 1, 2, 3 etc.

By default file is saved to your current Python directory.
